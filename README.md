# Road Accident Data Analysis using Excel

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze UK road accident data and examine the influence of road infrastructure on the frequency and severity of road accidents. The project aims to provide valuable insights to stakeholders such as the Ministry of Transport, Road Transport Department, Emergency Services Department, Road Transport Corps, Transport Operators, Traffic Management Agencies, Public, and Media. These insights will aid in making informed decisions on how to enhance road safety and reduce the risk and severity of road accidents in the UK.

## Dataset
It is an Excel file that contains 3.07 million rows and 21 data fields

## Insights from the UK Road Accident Data Analysis:

1. Primary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

  The analysis focused on two primary KPIs: the volume of road accidents and the severity of those accidents.
  Visualizations were created for each of these KPIs to better understand their patterns and trends.

2. Monthly Trend of Accidents: 

  A pivot table and line chart were generated to illustrate the monthly trend of accidents over the years.
  This visualization helps identify any recurring patterns or seasonal variations in accident occurrences.

3. Impact of Road Type on Accidents:

  Another pivot table was created to investigate the relationship between road types and accident frequency.
  The chart, presented as a bar chart, displayed the actual number of accidents for each road type.
  Data labels were added to the chart to show the specific occurrences for each road type, but some overcrowding occurred.
  To address this, a custom number format was applied to enhance readability.

4. Influence of Road Conditions on Accidents:

 A pivot table was constructed to analyze the contribution of road conditions to accident incidents.
 The data for road conditions was categorized into five entries: wet, flood, snow, frost, and dry.
 To simplify the data and make it more concise, calculated fields were created to group similar conditions together (e.g., wet + flood = wet, snow + frost = snow).
 
The insights were visualized using a tree map chart, enabling a clear comparison of accident occurrences based on different road conditions.
These insights shed light on the impact of road infrastructure, road type, and road conditions on the volume and severity of road accidents in the UK. The visualizations provide stakeholders with valuable information to 
make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to improve road safety and reduce the risk of accidents.
